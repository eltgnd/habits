    "James Clear, writer of the critically-acclaimed productivity book Atomic Habits, declares that habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. This exploratory data analysis (EDA) focuses on Val's habits during his second semester of sophomore year. The goal is to extract data-driven insights that will be useful for his first semester of junior year. Specifically, the following data are used:\n",
    "- `habits`: Sourced from a Google Form Val made that records daily habits such as number of toothbrushes in a day, minutes meditated, and overall mood.\n",
    "- `exercise`: Sourced from Val's Strava account using the app's API. Strava is an app that lets users record their exercise data.\n",
    "- `steps`: Sourced from Val's Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 through the Samsung Health app.\n",
    "- `sleep`:  Sourced from Val's Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 through the Samsung Health app.\n",
    "- `events`: A table containing significant academic or extracurricular events Val participated in."

    "- Downloading my health data was done through the Samsung Health app. The data provided consists of JSON files and a lot of CSV files.
